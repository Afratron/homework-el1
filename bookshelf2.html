    Stephen Hawking describes how Aristotle's theory of absolute space came to an end following the introduction of Newtonian mechanics. In this description, whether an object is 'at rest' or 'in motion' depends on the inertial frame of reference of the observer; an object may be 'at rest' as viewed by an observer moving in the same direction at the same speed, or 'in motion' as viewed by an observer moving in a different direction and/or at a different speed. There is no absolute state of 'rest'. Moreover, Galileo Galilei also disproved Aristotle's theory that heavier bodies fall more quickly than lighter ones. He experimentally proved this by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluded that all objects would fall at the same rate and would reach the bottom at the same time unless an external force acted on them.

Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. They believed that if an event is measured using two accurate clocks in different states of motion from each other, they would agree on the amount of time that has passed (today, this is known to be untrue). The fact that the light travels with a finite speed was first explained by the Danish scientist Ole Rømer, by his observation of Jupiter and one of its moons Io. He observed that Io appears at different times when it revolves around Jupiter because the distance between Earth and Jupiter changes over time.

The actual propagation of light was described by James Clerk Maxwell who concluded that light travels in waves moving at a fixed speed. Maxwell and many other physicists argued that light must travel through a hypothetical fluid called aether, which was disproved by the Michelson–Morley experiment. Einstein and Henri Poincaré later argued that there is no need for aether to explain the motion of light, assuming that there is no absolute time. The special theory of relativity is based on this, arguing that light travels with a finite speed no matter what the speed of the observer is. Moreover, the speed of light is the fastest speed at which any information can travel.

Mass and energy are related by the famous equation {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}E = mc^2, which explains that an infinite amount of energy is needed for any object with mass to travel at the speed of light. A new way of defining a metre using speed of light was developed. "Events" can also be described by using light cones, a spacetime graphical representation that restricts what events are allowed and what are not based on the past and the future light cones. A 4-dimensional spacetime is also described, in which 'space' and 'time' are intrinsically linked. The motion of an object through space inevitably impacts the way in which it experiences time.

Einstein's general theory of relativity explains how the path of a ray of light is affected by 'gravity', which according to Einstein is an illusion caused by the warping of spacetime, in contrast to Newton's view which described gravity as a force which matter exerts on other matter. In spacetime curvature, light always travels in a straight path in the 4-dimensional "spacetime", but may appear to curve in 3-dimensional space due to gravitational effects. These straight-line paths are geodesics. The twin paradox, a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, considers that twins can age differently if they move at different speeds relative to each other, or even if they lived in different locations with unequal spacetime curvature. Special relativity is based upon arenas of space and time where events take place, whereas general relativity is dynamic where force could change spacetime curvature and which gives rise to the expanding Universe. Hawking and Roger Penrose worked upon this and later proved using general relativity that if the Universe had a beginning then it also must have an end.
